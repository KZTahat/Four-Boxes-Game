# Four-Boxes-Game

Clicking Game:<br>
`4` colors boxes Clicking game where the player must click only the light box with a counter to count the correct clicks.
<br>
The game starts after the first click, after every correct click, the clicked box will turn off and one of the other three boxes will light up randomly and the counter will be increased by one.
<br>
If the player took more than `2` seconds without clicking, the light box will change randomly and the counter will be decreased by one ( if the counter is zero then its game over)
If the player clicked on a wrong box then its game over the boxes will disappear and the final result will be displayed on the screen.
<br>
<br>
You are going to use HTML, CSS Javascript to do this :<br>
`HTML` : user interface ( creating the boxes, and the counter )<br>
`CSS` : to design the game ( boxes position, size and colors)<br>
`Javascript` : for DOM manipulation ( adding event listeners, changing colors, increasing and decreasing the counter and showing the final result ) <br>
